Question 1a and 2 : Answered in the Doc
Question 3: Plot the blood concentration vs. time if the inhalation was delayed by 60 min.
%x = zeros(60,1)
%PLAX_INHAL1 = [x; reshape(PLAX_INHAL(1:301), [], 1)]
%plot(TIME,PLAX_INHAL1,'g')
Note: I didnt know how I could modify the time to go up to 361, so I used the following method instead. This way the time was delayed too.
TIME1 = TIME+60;

Question 5: You need to report on blood concentrations if the inhalant was administered via a continuous mask respirator, starting at t=20 min,  that delivered .1 mg/dL over 10 min, or a total Plaxamaxin dose of 1 mg/dL.
b. Generate the mask respirator plaxamaxin administration function (in mg/dL), ‘resp_plax(t)’, and plot this function.
%TIME2 = TIME+20;
resp_plax_t = zeros(301,1);
resp_plax_t(20:29)=0.1; %(10 times when dosage was administrated, if we do 30, it will be 11)

c. Plot the blood concentration of plaxamaxin, ‘resp_plax_blood(t)’, that arises in response to this administration function.
resp_plax_blood_t1 = conv(resp_plax_t,PLAX_INHAL_BLOOD);
resp_plax_blood_t = resp_plax_blood_t1((1:301),1);

d. Generate and Plot the blood concentration of plaxamaxin, ‘resp_plax_blood_2(t)’ if the inhalant was administered via a continuous mask respirator, starting at t=20 min,  that delivered .1 mg/dL over 60 min, or a total Plaxamaxin dose of 6 mg/dL. Describe the difference.
resp_plax_2t = zeros(301,1);
resp_plax_2t(20:79)=0.1; %(10 times when dosage was administrated, if we do 30, it will be 11)

6. Plaxamaxin is primarily cleared from the blood by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. You wish to determine kidney’s clearance of Plaxamaxin by administering a bolus intravenous (IV) injection of plaxamaxin of 1 mg/dL into the blood at time=0. The bolus IV injection function is given as INJ_PLAX_BLOOD. The kidney’s clearance is measured as the concentration of Plaxamaxin in the urine (mg/dL) from a urinary catheter and given as PLAX_URINE
b. Plot Plaxamxin concentration in the urine if it was administered via a continuous mask respirator that delivered .1 mg/dL over 10 min, starting at t=20 min. 
urine_plax_blood_t1 = conv(resp_plax_t,PLAX_URINE);
